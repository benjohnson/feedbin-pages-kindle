# Feedbin-Pages-Kindle

I really love [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). And I love my [Kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle). Wouldn't it be nice if they could play together?

One of the best features of Instapaper is the ability to send articles to the Kindle. When I moved to using [Feedbin Pages](https://feedbin.com/blog/2019/08/20/save-webpages-to-read-later/) I really missed this. This service can take your articles saved to Feedbin pages and send them to your Kindle.

We focus on readability. Proper hyphenation, line heights, etc. We don't use Kindle Periodicals because it doesn't look as nice.
